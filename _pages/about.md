<p>I graduated from Georgia Tech with a Masters in Computer Engineering in 2015. Since graduation, I've worked as an engineer for numerous exclusive companies including Intel and Microsoft. I pride myself in being multidisciplinary as my education and experience spans from technology consulting to hardware and software engineering. I've lived in some amazing places including France, Italy, Miami, Atlanta, and now San Francisco. I'm avid traveler and technologist at heart.</p>
