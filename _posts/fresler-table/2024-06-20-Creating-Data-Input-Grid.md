Creating a data input grid in your React application can be a challenging task, especially when you aim for both functionality and a seamless user experience. The Fresler-Table library offers a powerful yet straightforward solution to this problem, providing robust features to handle dynamic data input with ease. One example of where this type of input layout may be particularly useful is when users need to add many contacts to an app at once. Rather than provide a long form with different sections for each contact, we can use this more tabular approach to better organize the data and increase the density of information for the user.

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of setting up a data input grid using the Fresler-Table library. We'll cover everything from installation to customization, ensuring you have a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage this library for your specific needs. You'll learn how to create an input grid that not only allows users to input data efficiently but also integrates smoothly with your existing React components.

If you get lost, don't worry! You can clone a more thorough example from the [FreslerTable example repo](https://github.com/gas6262/fresler-table-examples/tree/main/examples/data-input).

Let's get started!


## 1. Install The Table Library And Set Up Your App

If you don't already have a React app that you want to work with, use [this tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) to create a basic "Hello World" app.

Once you have your app created, add `@fresler/fresler-table` to your package.json file using npm.

```bash
npm install @fresler/fresler-table --save
```

You must also remove `<React.StrictMode>` from your react app if present. This component prevents the drag and drop functionality of the table library from working correctly. The component reference may be located in your `index.js` or `main.tsx` file. Remove the reference from your index.js file (or wherever the reference may be) like so:

src/index.jsx
```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.tsx";
import "./index.css";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  // <React.StrictMode>
  <App />,
  // </React.StrictMode>,
);
```

## 2. Define The Columns Of The Data

First, choose where you would like to add your data input grid. In this simple example, we will add the data input grid to our `App.jsx` file. First we will define the columns or fields needed for each row/contact that the user will add. In this simple example, we will limit those fields to *Name*, *Job Title*, and *Email* like so:

```js
const columns = [
  {
    displayName: 'Name',
    field: 'full_name',
    type: 'string',
    editable: true,
  },
  {
    displayName: 'Job Title',
    field: 'job_title',
    type: 'string',
    editable: true,
  },
  {
    displayName: 'Email',
    field: 'email',
    type: 'string',
    editable: true,
  },
];
```

## 3. Define Your Data

To store the data that the user adds, we will use a React state variable, called *data*. We will also add this to our `App.jsx` file.

```jsx
const [data, setData] = useState([]);
```

## 4. Display Your Data Input Grid

Now we are ready to display the data grid. Simply import the `fresler-table` library and instantiate the table in your `App.tsx` like below to display it.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import reactLogo from './assets/react.svg';
import viteLogo from '/vite.svg';
import './App.css';
import { FreslerTable } from '@fresler/fresler-table';
import '@fresler/fresler-table/css';

export const columns = [
  {
    displayName: 'Name',
    field: 'full_name',
    type: 'string',
    editable: true,
  },
  {
    displayName: 'Job Title',
    field: 'job_title',
    type: 'string',
    editable: true,
  },
  {
    displayName: 'Email',
    field: 'email',
    type: 'string',
    editable: true,
  },
];

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  return (
    <div style={{ width: '90vw', height: '90vh' }}>
      <FreslerTable initData={data} initCols={columns} updateData={setData} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## 5. Add Data

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

Youâ€™ve successfully created a sleek and intuitive data input grid using the Fresler-Table library. Now it's time to test the interface by adding some data. Simply type in the *Add New Row* input field and press *enter* to add new data. You can easily navigate between cells using the *tab* key, making data entry quick and efficient. Your users will surely appreciate the streamlined and user-friendly interface.

If your example didnâ€™t work as expected or if you want to explore a more complex implementation, check out [this code sandbox](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-8ux9v9?file=README.md). For any issues or questions about the library, feel free to create an issue on the ![Fresler-Table GitHub repository](https://github.com/gas6262/fresler-table-examples/issues).
